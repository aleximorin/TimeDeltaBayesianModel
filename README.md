# TimeDeltaBayesianModel
An inverse model for alpine glacier ice thickness using one or multiple time intervals.
This work is related to a submitted paper to the [Journal Of Glaciology](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-glaciology). 
It aims to slightly modify the work from Douglas Brinkerhoff [in this paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2016.00008/full) 
to be able to use multiple time intervals in a conjoint inversion using mass conversation.
<p>
The submitted work also investigates the advantages of using satellite data from a slip-focused glacier-flow regime. 
This work aims to serve as a proof of concept that higher velocity data contains more information about basal topography, leading to higher quality inversions.
