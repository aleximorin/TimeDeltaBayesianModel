# TimeDeltaBayesianModel
An inverse model for alpine glacier ice thickness using one or multiple time intervals.
This work is related to a now submitted paper to the [Journal Of Glaciology](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-glaciology), with the collaborative work of Gwenn Flowers, [Andrew Nolan](https://github.com/andrewdnolan), [Douglas Brinkerhoff](https://dbrinkerhoff.org/) and Ã‰tienne Berthier. 

It aims to slightly modify the work from Douglas Brinkerhoff in [this paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2016.00008/full) 
to be able to use multiple time intervals in a conjoint inversion using a mass conversation equation. This means that we are trying to use glacier satellite data showing different dynamics i.e. steady state and/or surging).
We then investigate the advantages of using satellite data from a slip-focused glacier-flow regime. 
This work aims to serve as a proof of concept that higher velocity data contains more information about basal topography, leading to higher quality inversions. 

Andrew Nolan generated the synthetic data, simulating a surging glacier. The code used to do so can be [found here](https://github.com/andrewdnolan/Harmonic_Beds) (with a sweet animation of the synthetic surge).

Examples showing the code are available in the files `synthetic_example.py` and `realdata_example.py`. The  example with synthetic data highlights the various possibilities of the model and how it can use the different dynamics from a dataset for an inversion. The example with the real data showcases how we use velocities on a small surging glacier in Yukon to infer ice thickness.
